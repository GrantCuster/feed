  Lots of interesting points in these slides on game simulation design from Molleindustria. More and more, I feel like I want to experiment with creating simulation games, there's lots of good material in here about why that might be and how to do it ethically. I especially like the idea that game design can be the point in itself, because it reveals all games as designed.
