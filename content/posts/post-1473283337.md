  Returning to work on the Fast Forward Labs real estate prototype. This time taking what I learned from the structuring of the Lending Club project and applying it -- using Redux and a data-service layer to manage requests to the API (there are too many requests!). Just got the year timeline working again. The color coding here is likelihood you'll be able to afford a place in a neighborhood if you have $1,000,000 to spend.
