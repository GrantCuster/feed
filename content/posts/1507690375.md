  Turns out Universal Paperclips is a commentary on AI. I like the connection between the role taken on by a person playing a game and an AI trained on a specific task. A (good) game trains a person how to play through play. That's also what makes them a good candidate for training AI â€“ because everything you need to know about the game can be gleamed from trial and error as you play the game.
