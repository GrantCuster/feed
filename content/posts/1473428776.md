  From the landing page for Know Your Company. I like how straightforward the site is in general. Thinking about the Fast Forward Labs site, I wonder if we can use this format of a bolded first sentence/phrase to communicate our principles. So far I'd been trying it more with titles, but I like that this gives the space to elaborate a little more. It might let us come off a little less buzz-wordy, which is always a challenge.
