  FFL blog design after a mobile-first rebuild. After a lot of fiddling with the link blocks I added a gray border to them â€“ I was really trying to avoid borders and lines, but they make the hierarchy a lot clearer here. I also did a bunch of fiddling with the post-type text, including trying out small caps. Eventually I settled on kind of faking the small caps since the black weight didn't have a small cap variant and the bold one had kind of rough kerning anyway.
