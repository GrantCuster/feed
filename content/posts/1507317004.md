  I put up a page of media resources for FFL reports and prototypes. It's mostly for internal use, but kind of a nice overview of what we've put out. The files are pulled and displayed from folders using the github API. This is my second iteration of using github pages to list static directory contents. I like the system. I'd like to expand on it and make it more flexible at some point.
