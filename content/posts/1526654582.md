  The Creative Independent let's editors highlight certain passages to draw attention. It's a really nicely-scoped annotation feature -- easy to understand what is happening for both the audience and different editors, without going down a rabbit-hole of pull-quote or formatting options. It also opens up the possibility of doing other things with those highlights.
